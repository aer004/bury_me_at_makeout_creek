        <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCphVz0ZGns">First Love/Late Spring</a></h2>
        <p>The black hole of the window where you sleep</p>
        <p>The night breeze carries something sweet, a peach tree</p>
        <p>Wild women don't get the blues</p>
        <p>But I find that lately, I've been crying like a tall child</p>

        <p class="lyrics_margin">So please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe</p>
        <p>Please don't say you love me</p>
        <p>Mune ga hachikire-sōde</p>
        <p>One word from you and I would</p>
        <p>Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby</p>
        <p>Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in</p>

        <p class="lyrics_margin">And I was so young when I behaved twenty-five</p>
        <p>Yet now, I find I've grown into a tall child</p>
        <p>And I don't wanna go home yet</p>
        <p>Let me walk to the top of the big night sky</p>

        <p class="lyrics_margin">Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe</p>
        <p>Please don't say you love me</p>
        <p>Mune ga hachikire-sōde</p>
        <p>One word from you and I would</p>
        <p>Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby</p>
        <p>Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in</p>

        <p class="lyrics_margin">One word from you and I would</p>
        <p>Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby</p>
